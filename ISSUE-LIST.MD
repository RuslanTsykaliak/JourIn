## Fixed Issues

- **Visual Glitch on Button Focus (`focus:ring-500`):**
  - **Description:** When the "Generate Post Prompt" button was clicked or focused, a visual inconsistency appeared where a section of the screen turned white, contrasting with the gray background. This was particularly noticeable because the `focus:ring-500` Tailwind CSS class was used.
  - **Root Cause:** The `focus:ring-500` class was likely referencing a ring color that was not properly defined or available in the Tailwind CSS configuration, leading to an undefined or unexpected visual outline on focus. This interacted poorly with the transparent backgrounds of parent containers, making the conditionally rendered white components appear abruptly.
  - **Resolution:** Removed the problematic `focus:ring-500` class from the button styling. (Note: The underlying issue was related to the interaction of transparent parent containers and conditionally rendered components with explicit backgrounds, which was addressed by ensuring consistent background colors across the main content area.)
